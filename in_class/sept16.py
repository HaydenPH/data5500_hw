# Three pillars of object oriented programming
# 1. Inheritance - parent-child relationship exists in classes
# 2. Encapsulation - Public/Private data, control 
# 3. Poly Morphism - 
# Classes are good for combining data and functionality. Dictionaries don't allow functions within.
# __ = hidden data
